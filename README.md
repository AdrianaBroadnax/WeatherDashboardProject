# WeatherDashboardProject

## assets / displayWeather.js
First I started out by listing all of my var characters needed to run this app.
Next I put the APIKey that helped with calling the API.
Then, I needed an array of cities to appear when the client searches a city near them.
After, the weather was supppose to display with the date, ,temperature, humidity, and wind.
The uvIndex was going to display next based on the city shown. 
After that information appeared, a 5 day forcast will be shwon to give the client a heads up on the weather for the week.
Every search will be saved to the lcoal storage and the client has the option to clear the history as well.
At the bottom, I have a list of the buttons needed and the on click events.

## index.html

First I started off by linking the style.css and the bootstrap to the index.html for designing purposes. 
Added the header, "Weather Dashboard and started with a container. 
The first container was to hold the "Search a City Near You" and the search button.
Next, I made a div in otrder to show the weather based on the city input. 
Then, it was suppose to show the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
Finally, at the bottom a 5 day forecast was suppose to appear with the temperature, humidity, and wind.
At the bottom of the page there is an option to clear the history. 


## style.css

for the style of the page I was going to go with a more beach theme, I more happy go lucky theme, but some way, some how the style.css is not connected to the index.html so i have to go back and fix that
