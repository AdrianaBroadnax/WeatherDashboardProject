# WeatherDashboardProject

## assets / displayWeather.js
First I started out by listing all of my var characters needed to run this app.
Next I put the APIKey that helped with calling the API.
Then, I needed an array of cities to appear when the client searches a city near them.
After, the weather was supppose to display with the date, ,temperature, humidity, and wind.
The uvIndex was going to display next based on the city shown. 
After that information appeared, a 5 day forcast will be shwon to give the client a heads up on the weather for the week.
Every search will be saved to the lcoal storage and the client has the option to clear the history as well.
At the bottom, I have a list of the buttons needed and the on click events.
